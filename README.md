ðŸš€ Project Update: Building a Server with Express.js & Testing APIs with Postman ðŸš€

Today, I worked on a backend project where I created a server using Express.js and built a simple API. Along with development, I also used Postman to test and handle API requests, which gave me hands-on experience in both coding and debugging.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

=> Developed a basic Express.js server

=> Implemented a GET API endpoint (app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World')))

=> Explored how request (req) works (URL, headers, query, body)

=> Practiced sending responses (res) with res.send(), res.json(), res.status()

=> Learned the role of APIs as communication bridges between applications

=> Used Postman to test endpoints and validate responses effectively

This was a great learning experience that strengthened my fundamentals in backend development. Excited to keep building and exploring more advanced APIs!
